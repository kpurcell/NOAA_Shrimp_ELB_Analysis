\section*{Introduction}
Marine and coastal ecosystems are being increasingly affected by patterns of environmental hypoxia which have been documented in over 400 marine systems affecting greater than 240,000 km2 \cite{diaz_spreading_2008}.  Environmental hypoxia, a condition of < 2.0 mg l-1 dissolved oxygen, is generally a product of excess consumption of oxygen through respiration and chemical processes relative to the rate of production.  Hypoxia, especially in shallow water coastal systems, is more common in areas with high nutrient inputs, longer residence times and physical stratification, characteristics common to coastal and estuarine systems (Rabalais Hypoxia 2009).  Currently, the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) experiences one of the largest seasonal hypoxia events in the western hemisphere \cite{rabalais_beyond_2002, rabalais_characterization_2007}.  The areal extent of Gulf hypoxia coverage has been estimated annually since 1985 and has shown significant variation exceeding 20,000 km2 in recent years (Rabalais ?, Turner et al. 2008 via aggregations: Figure 1).  Hindcasting models and paleo-indicator studies show indications of low oxygen stress within the Gulf beginning in the early 1900s becoming increasingly severe during the 1960s and 1970s \cite{justic_forecasting_2007, rabalais+sediments_2007, greene_multiple_2009}.  The causal mechanisms for natural and anthropogenically mediated hypoxia have been extensively discussed in the literature (Bianchi et al. 2010, Rabalais et al 2010, Zhang et al. 2010) with a clear consensus that Gulf hypoxia is driven by increased eutrophication subsequent to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River systems which is directly adjacent to the Louisiana coastal shelf.  The increased nutrient loading to the coastal shelf and the vertical stratification that result from seasonal river flow creates ideal conditions for the annual development of bottom water hypoxia (Rabalais et al 2002, Bianchi et al. 2010).  The hypoxic zone (region with < 2 mg l-1 DO) is highly variable spatially, depending on prevailing weather patterns and coastal currents (XXX).

The Gulf shrimp fishery is an open access, otter trawl fishery occurring throughout the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Mexico Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), from southern Florida to the Texas-Mexico border.  The majority of fishing effort occurs in the northwestern Gulf (< -88Â° Lon., Fig 1A) and predominantly targets three Penaeid shrimp species: the Brown \textit{Farfantepenaeus aztecus} and to a lesser extent the White \textit{Litopenaeus setiferus} and Pink \textit{Farfantepenaeus duorarum} shrimp.  The fishery began in 1917 with an inshore artisanal fleet focusing on a single species (L. setiferus) and has grown to large commercialized fleet in excess of 20,000 vessels (Condrey and Fuller 2005, Diamond 2004).  Historically, Gulf shrimp landings provided roughly 73\% percent of the total shrimp landings in the US (Iverson and Martin 2008) and the fishery was valued at >500M annually, making it one of the most profitable fisheries in the US (Diamond 2004, Nance 1993 via NGOMEX).  

The region of the northwestern Gulf associated with the Mississippi-Atchafaylaya river plum has been referred to as the "Fertile Fishery Crescent" (Gunter 1963 via NGOMEX) and has supported some of the most productive fishing grounds within U.S. coastal waters (Chesney et al 2000).  The spatial overlap between this fertile fishing ground and the spatial extent of seasonal hypoxia has led to a number of studies focused on the interaction between nektonic populations and coastal hypoxia (Caddy 1993, Breitburg et al. 2009, Rose et al. 2009, Essington and Paulsen 2010).  More specifically, Craig et al. (2005) examined the spatial distribution of F. aztecus in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and reported that wide spread hypoxia (> 20,000 km2) results in a ~25 \% reduction in shrimp habitat coupled with shifts in spatial distribution both inshore and offshore of hypoxic regions.  Craig and Crowder (2005) reported that both \textit{F. aztecus} and Atlantic Croaker \textit{Micropogonias undulates} show clear patterns of avoidance in very low oxygenated waters and increased abundance at moderate (1.6-3.7 mg l-1) levels of dissolved oxygen, indicating possible associations with hypoxia edge habitats.  More recently, Craig (2012) examined two 4000-5000 km2 regions of the Louisiana coastal shelf, and found that for F. aztecus and a number of finfish species dissolved oxygen avoidance thresholds were on average 1-3 mg l-1 and that all species showed strong aggregations within 1-3 km of that edge of hypoxia.  

While increased patterns of spatial aggregation could serve as a spatially mediated response to hypoxia stress it could also facilitate the possibility of increased fishery bycatch or patterns of hyperstability within the fishery that could compromise management and threaten the long-term resilience of populations.  Fishery bycatch, especially within the trawl fisheries, has been identified as a principle threat to global commercial fish stocks (Davies et al. 2009, Kumar and Deepthi 2006).  Since the 1980s, Gulf shrimp trawl fishery bycatch has been identified as a key management issues and has undergone considerable scrutiny (Crowder and Murawski 1998).  The issue of fishery bycatch within the Gulf shrimp fishery was of significant threat to justify an amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act that requires research focused on issues of bycatch and lead to implementation of an observer program within the fishery (Diamond 2004).  Gallaway (2003) indicated that issues of high bycatch rates within the shrimp fishery dictate a richer understanding of the temporal and spatial trends in fishing effort and how those trends are affected by alterations in the abiotic environment.  

In traditional fishery stock assessment models it is assumed that CPUE is proportional to resource abundance or population size (Quinn and Deriso 1999, Erisman et al. 2011) and this relationship is essential to sound management decisions.  Hyperstability is a disproportional condition in which catch per unit effort (CPUE) displays a non-linear relationship with resource abundance (Harley et al 2001).  This condition can facilitate overestimates of resource biomass and underestimates of fishery mortality, which can compromise the management of fishery stocks (Crecco and Overholtz 1990, Erisman et al. 2011, MORE CITATIONS).  The spatial and temporal allocation of fishing effort dictates the relationship between CPUE and resource abundance and therefor any changes in the spatial distribution of effort could create patterns of hyperstability that could obfuscate the effects of hypoxia stress on coastal fishery populations.  

In this study we examine the relationship between the spatial allocation of fishing effort within the northwestern Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery and a number of important environmental and economic variables affecting the spatial region of the fishery.  We evaluate the hypothesis that hypoxia induced shifts in the spatial distribution of coastal nekton could drive the changes in the spatial allocation of fishing effort within the Gulf shrimp fishery.  Further, we discuss the implications of changes in the allocation of fishery effort with respect to the future management the Gulf shrimp fishery and the ecology of the northwestern Gulf region.

\section*{Results}
GAM regression models were developed to examine the role of environmental variables on fishing effort metrics for both the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelves employing both stationary and non-stationary formulations.  Comparison of model formulations showed similar patterns for all response variables with non-stationary model formulations statistically superior to stationary formulations in terms of both GCV scores and deviance explained percentages (Table 1), and therefore will be the focus of our analysis.  Evaluation of model residuals showed no significant departures from the underlying assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity.

The non-stationary regression model for fishing effort on the Louisiana shelf had significant effects for all model parameters (Table 1).  Dissolved oxygen had a marginal positive effect on the quantity of fishing effort at values < 2 mg l-1 and displayed a negative effect in waters > 5mg l-1 (Figure 2A).  In terms of depth, total fishing effort showed a positive effect in waters shallower than 20 m and negative effects in waters > 20 m (Figure 2B).  The market price for shrimp (pPND) showed limited effect on overall fishing effort (Figure 2C) and weekly fuel prices seemed to show a generally positive correlation with effort (Figure 2D).  The utility of the geospatial variable-coefficient models is their ability to explore the effects of space, and spatially variable environments, on a response variable, in this case distribution of shrimping effort.  The effect of spatial location on the Louisiana shelf, based on average conditions for all other covariates, showed the highest fishing effort east of the river delta and in offshore waters between Atchafalaya Bay and the Louisiana bight (Figure 3A).  Additionally, there are regions of higher effort in the Louisiana bight increasing into mid-shore waters and toward the west and from the mouth of Atchafalaya Bay moving offshore (Figure 3A, warm colors).  Areas of low effort were identified primarily offshore of Atchafalaya Bay and the western Louisiana shelf as well as in inshore waters adjacent to Terrebonne Parish, LA (Figure 3A cooler colors).  In contrast, we identified spatially explicit effects of area of hypoxia on the spatial allocation of fishing effort (Figure 3B).  The Louisiana shelf model showed positive effects of hypoxia on fishing in inshore waters adjacent to Terrebonne bay and in offshore waters west of Atchafalaya Bay.  We observed negative effects inshore from the mouth of the Atchafalaya Bay west towards the Texas border and in the Louisiana bight moving west into offshore waters (Figure 3B). 

The non-stationary model for fishing effort on the Texas shelf, a model developed because of the regions relatively limited annual hypoxia, showed significant effects for all model parameters (Table 1).  The relationship between dissolved oxygen and fishing effort in Texas waters showed negative effects in waters < 3 mg l-1 and positive effects in waters > 6 mg l-1 (Figure 4A).  On the Texas shelf there was limited data in waters <2 mg l-1, (0.1 percent, n=35) whereas on the Louisiana shelf hypoxic data (< 2 mg l-1) where much more substantial (25percent , n=7085).  Depth showed highly negative effects in waters < 15 meters, in waters deeper than 15m there was a bimodal distribution with positive effects in coastal waters ~25m and again in waters ~70m in depth (Figure 4B).  The effect of market price on fishing effort showed marginally negative effects at values < 3 USD per pound, with positive effects at values > 3 USD per pound (Figure 4C).  Fuel prices were again highly variable but seemed to show an overall positive correlation with overall tow duration.  The geospatial smooth for the Texas shelf showed areas of high fishing effort, in waters adjacent to Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi Bay (Figure 5A).  Fishing effort was also high offshore of Galveston Bay, but generally decreased moving from inshore to deeper waters for the Texas shelf (Figure 5A).  Spatially explicit effects for the variable-coefficient parameter were also identified in the Texas model showing positive effects adjacent to both Galveston to the north and south of Corpus Christi Bay, with additional areas of positive effects further south towards the US-Mexico border (Figure 5B).  The model also showed some response in central Texas waters with positive effects in inshore waters adjacent to Matagorda Bay (Figure 5B).  Negative effects were limited in comparison to the Louisiana model but some regions were identified directly adjacent to both Galveston and Corpus Christi Bays (Figure 5B).  

To further elucidate the effect of annual hypoxia on the spatial allocation of fishery resources on the Louisiana and Texas coastal shelves, we conducted model simulations for both regions comparing high (20,500 km2) and low (8000 km2) aerial extents of hypoxia (Figure 6).  These values were chosen to contrast two ends of the bottom water conditions spectrum for the northwestern Gulf and are values upon which our models were trained.  Predicted surfaces for fishing effort allocation display dramatic spatial effects for the Louisiana shelf under high hypoxia conditions (Figure 6A) in which effort is reduced inshore west of the Mississippi River delta relative to low hypoxia conditions (Figure 6B).  These models were simulated based on fishing effort under different hypoxia conditions each representing different years 2007 (20,500 km-2) and 2009 (8000 km-2), however annual fishery effort was relatively similar in both years with 80,732 and 76,427 tow hours, respectively.  This similarity in total fishing effort between model simulations indicates that relative shifts in effort allocation may be informative.  For instance on the Louisiana shelf we see effort increases both east of the Mississippi River delta and offshore of the Atchafalaya Bay, these increases agree spatially, with predicted model effects of area of hypoxia on fishing effort (Figure 3B).  By contrast the allocation of fishing effort for the Texas shelf model displays little qualitative difference between these high and low hypoxia years, the primary difference consist of northward shifts in effort allocation primarily offshore of Galveston Bay (Figure 6 C, D), which also concurs with the model predictions (Figure 5B).  
Models for average tow duration and tow density were conducted to indirectly assess tow quality in the absence of corresponding landings information.  Both models showed significant effects for all model parameters, with the exception of Julian day (d), for average tow duration and tow density in Texas waters (Table 1), which were not significant in either model formulation.  Model smooth relationships for average tow duration and tow density were qualitatively similar to total effort relationships for all model parameters except for dissolved oxygen.  The average duration of a tow on the Louisiana shelf was negatively associated with waters of < 2.5-3mg l-1 and > 5 mg l-1 dissolved oxygen (Figure 7A).  On the Texas coast we saw negative effects of average tow duration in waters < 3 mg l-1 and positive effects in waters > 6 mg l-1 dissolved oxygen (Figure 7B).  In contrast to average tow duration, models for tow count showed positive effects at low dissolved oxygen levels, indicating an increase in the number of tows performed under hypoxic conditions.  On the Louisiana shelf, our model showed positive effects at values < 3 mg l-1 with the highest positive effects in waters < 1 mg l-1, and negative effects in waters > 3 mg l-1 (Figure 8A).  On the Texas shelf the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on tow count was slightly more variable than on the Louisiana shelf.  This model showed intermittent positive effects of dissolved oxygen on tow count in waters < 5.5 mg l-1 and negative effects in waters > 5.5 mg l-1 (Figure 8B).  The highest positive effects trend for the Texas shelf were found in waters < 2 mg l-1 (Figure 8B), however with such a small sample of data in hypoxic waters on the Texas shelf the confidence intervals includes the entire range of positive effects values.

\section*{Discussion}
Our analysis of three fishing effort metrics, describing 8 years and ~ 217,000 individual tow records, shows strong indications of a spatially mediated response by the Gulf shrimp fishery to hypoxia in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.  We observed limited positive and negative effects of dissolved oxygen on the quantity of shrimping fishing effort in hypoxic regions of the Louisiana shelf, however we did observe dramatic shifts in the spatial allocation of fishery resources when the annual area of hypoxia was considered.  Previous studies have utilized these methods to examine distribution shifts in biological resources (Bacheler et al. 2010, Ciannelli et al. 2007, Bartolino et al. 2012), however, to the authors knowledge, this is the first application to the distribution of fishery resources with respect to environmental conditions.  
The spatial response observed by the Gulf shrimp fishery, specifically an offshore shift along the western Louisiana shelf and an inshore and westward shift on the eastern shelf would seem to fit the results of previous studies focused on species distributional responses to hypoxia.  In Craig (2012) it was observed that the abundance of F. aztecus on the Louisiana shelf was elevated at distances from 1-3 km from the edge of the hypoxic zone, additionally this study showed that positive catches were spatially distributed both inshore and offshore of the hypoxic zone.  Further, additional studies have documented clear patterns of low oxygen (< 3 mg l-1) avoidance behavior among populations of F. aztecus and other nektonic species (Craig et al. 2005, Craig and Crowder 2005).  While these studies temporally overlap our study by only a single year (2004) the apparent pattern of spatially mediated avoidance of low oxygen conditions does display a spatial similarity to the response of the fishery itself, and would seem to support our hypothesis that while coastal hypoxia does not seem to be negatively effecting landings (Breitberg 2009, Diaz and Solow 1999??, Chesney et al. 2001) there are clear patterns of spatial effects on the allocation of effort which could have both ecological and economics consequences.  
The quasi-experimental framework created in our study, through the model comparison between the Louisiana and Texas shelves, shows us several important findings.  First, we did see a negative effect of low dissolved oxygen on fishing effort in our analysis of the Texas shelf, this negative effect was observed in waters < 3mg l -1, and was not observed in the Louisiana model.  This finding was not surprising given that the low occurrence of hypoxia on the Texas shelf, recall that our data set had only a small number of hypoxic data points for the Texas region (n=35) in comparison to the Louisiana shelf (n=7085).  This difference in the magnitude of hypoxia would allow for easier avoidance of hypoxic conditions spatially, in Texas waters relative to Louisiana waters.  Additionally, we found that the market price for shrimp landings had positive effects on effort on the Texas shelf, specifically at values > 3 USD per pound.  This difference between the Louisiana and Texas shelves would seem to fit a traditional fishery economics model, in which profit maximization of the firm, or the fisherman, dictates the behavior of the firm (van Putten et al. 2012).  Due to the Texas seasonal closure (Klima et al 1982, Matlock et al. 2010), shrimp populations on the Texas shelves are typically of greater maturity and thereby greater size during the period of fishery operation (mid-June-mid-July), this coupled with differences in the size of fishery fleets between Texas (n=2988) and Louisiana (n=9778; Diamond 2004) would favor a result in which more effort is expended on larger, and on average higher priced, shrimp landings relative to the Louisiana fishery.  Finally, the spatial shifts in fishing effort offshore and to the north and south of Galveston and Corpus Christi bays and a small positive region inshore adjacent to Matagorda Bay are qualitative distinct from those observed for the Louisiana shelf.  These findings, especially spatial shifts adjacent to Corpus Christi and Matagorda Bays were unexpected due to the variable-coefficient parameter being based on the aerial extent of hypoxia which typically does not extend south of Galveston Bay (Rabalais 2002).  While the magnitude and range of the positive effects along the Texas shelf are smaller than those on the Louisiana shelf it could indicate that the fishery responds to hypoxia in aggregate and not, as hypothesized, with regionally distinct behavior.  This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the spatial shifts observed do not seem to coincide with what is known about the incidence of hypoxia along the Texas coastal shelf (Osterman 2003).  Dimarco et al (2012) showed, based on 2007-2008 SEAMAP data, that the Mississippi-Atchafalaya river system is not the only causal mechanism for hypoxia on the Texas shelf, however the only river system that feeds directly to the coastal shelf and not through an embayment or an estuary is the Brazos River (Harper et al. 1991, Dimarco et al. 2012) which is located just south of Galveston Bay and relatively far from the positive effect shifts we observed adjacent to Matagorda or Corpus Christi Bays.  
One criticism of our study design could be that without tow specific landings information, a reduction in fishing effort within or adjacent to low oxygen regions could be seen as ambiguous.  This ambiguity derives from the issue of hyperstability, a condition in which catch rates remain unchanged regardless of reductions in population abundance because the fishery is better able to target and harvest a given resource (Rose and Kulka 1999, Harley 2001: from proposal).  To address these issues we developed models based on two additional response variables: average tow duration and tow density to indirectly evaluate tow quality.  The underlying assumption for all of our statistical models is that the parties (fisherman) being examined are following a profit maximization scheme and their behaviors are dictated by an underlying imperative to maximize returns while minimizing effort (Branch et al. 2006, van Putten et al 2012, ).  Given this assumption and the knowledge that shrimp fisherman possess knowledge about landings accumulation rates based on readings from a tensiometer, a device that measures tension on the trawl rigging, our finding for the Louisiana self that at dissolved oxygen values < 2.5 mg l-1 average tow duration is decreasing could indicated reduced tow quality in hypoxic conditions.  We also found evidence of higher tow density within grid cells that have dissolved oxygen levels < 3 mg l-1 along the Louisiana shelf, possibly indicating increased searching behavior within low oxygen habitat.  To a lesser degree similar patterns were observed in low oxygen conditions within the Texas fishery indicating that these fishery behaviors may indeed be a response to catch indicators and not solely a location driven response to previous knowledge concerning the annual region over which hypoxia occurs.  
If the spatial dynamics of the shrimp fishery are changing in response to seasonal hypoxia, increased opportunities for new biological interaction with non-target species could be created.  Nance et al. (1998) quantified levels of bycatch biomass within the shrimp trawl fishery and found that on average 29 kg of bycatch, or roughly 1300 organisms per hour, were captured by Gulf shrimp trawl fisherman.  While management initiatives have been developed since this time, such as bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), their efficacy has had diminishing returns over time (Foster and Scott-Denton 2004, Diamond 2004).  It would seem, given that previous studies have reported that shrimp and nektonic species aggregate within 1-3 km of the edge of hypoxic zones (Craig et al. 2005, Craig 2012), that any attempt by the fishery to modify its spatial deployment in response to or in anticipation of hypoxia effects, will increase opportunities for bycatch and additional non-target species interactions to develop.  
While our analysis does not permit a quantification of the spatial extent of the Gulf shrimp fishery, differences in the spatial extent of positive effects on fishing effort on both the Louisiana and Texas shelves does imply spatial patterns over which we find positive effects of annual hypoxia on fishing effort.  A visual comparison of the predicted spatial effort landscapes during a high and low hypoxia year shows a clear reduction in regions of high fishing effort.  This result would seem to concur with previous studies that showed that in years with spatially extensive bottom water hypoxia (> 20,000 km2) reductions in brown shrimp (F. aztecus) habitat (~25 percent) can be observed along the Louisiana shelf (Craig et al. 2005).  Without a quantifiable measure of the spatial extent of the fishery it is difficult to make conclusions concerning the economic ramifications of spatial shifts in fishery operations.  While we observe changes in the spatial regions at which the fishery operates in response to hypoxia the possibility that an overall reduction in the spatial extent of fishery operations could mitigate such economic consequences.  Therefore, while our findings are strictly suggestive they do seem to indicate that further examination of the spatial extent of fishery operations could be warranted, especially considering the economic and ecological ramifications such changes would have on both the fishery and the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.  
In summary, our analysis indicates that the estimated annual extent of hypoxia on the coastal shelf of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico has a significant effect on the spatial dynamics of fishery resources.  In addition, we found that levels of dissolved oxygen have significant non-linear effects on patterns of fishery behavior (tow duration, and tow number) and these patterns suggest reduced catch and increased searching behavior within low oxygen habitat, based on a profit maximization model of fishery behavior.  Recently, the effect of seasonal hypoxia on commercial fisheries within the Gulf of Mexico has been pejoratively dismissed (Cowan 2009), justified by the consistent increases observed in fishery landings (Chesney et al. 2000, Chesney et al 2000b, De Mutsert et al 2008) and a general lack of fishery losses in economic rents, or profits (NMFS document??).  Additionally, it is argued that the detrimental effects of nutrient inputs into hypoxic coastal systems are often mitigated or offset by the inherent flexibility of nektonic populations (Breitburg 2002).  However, the dynamics of fisheries is such that detrimental effects do not always manifest as direct loss in rents (Examples??).  Previous studies have shown that in nektonic species the impact of hypoxia is primarily observed not in population dynamics but rather in spatial shifts in abundance (Criag and Crowder 2005, Craig et al. 2012, other systems?), supporting the theory that vagile species will move to avoid stressful and deleterious environments if possible.  Our observed changes in the spatial dynamics of the Gulf shrimp fishery constitute substantive indirect effects of hypoxia and eutrophication.  Further, changes in the spatial dynamics of the shrimp fishery could have direct impacts on fishery rents through increased searching behaviors within low oxygen habitats and possibly through increased travel distances to harvest locations.  In addition, to these direct impacts there exists increased opportunities for indirect effects of hypoxia by way of increased bycatch rates due to spatial aggregation and hypoxia mediated dispersal patterns of other non-target nektonic species.  In conclusion, while we historically observed consistent patterns of fishery landings within coastal fisheries in the face of increased occurrence of coastal hypoxia, it is important to recognize that spatially mediated responses to hypoxia will have effects on the ecology and management of fishery resources especially in light of an increased focus on ecosystem based management practices.
