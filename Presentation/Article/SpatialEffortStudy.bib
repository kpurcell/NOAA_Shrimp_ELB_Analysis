	abstract = {Hypoxia is often associated with increasing nutrient loadings and has clear mortality effects on sessile organisms, but its population effects on mobile organisms in coastal environments are uncertain. The evidence for hypoxia having population level effects is laboratory experiments, many examples of localized effects in nature, a few population-level examples, fish kills, and intuition. Despite the perception by many people, none of these provide conclusive evidence of widespread population responses to hypoxia. We synthesize the results from seven ecological simulation models that examined how low dissolved oxygen ({DO)} affected fish at the individual, population, and community levels. These models represent a variety of species, simulate the dynamics at a range of temporal scales and spatial scales, and impose a variety of subsets of possible {DO} effects. Several patterns emerged from the accumulated results. First, predicted responses were large in simpler models, and small to large in more complex models. Second, while the main effects of increased hypoxia were generally small to moderate, there were instances of relatively large indirect effects and interaction effects. Indirect effects involved growth and mortality responses due to altered spatial distribution (rather than due directly to {DO)} and food web interactions. Interaction effects were larger responses to hypoxia when other factors were at certain levels (e.g., responses at low versus high fish densities). Interactions also occurred when the predicted responses were larger than would be expected by the sum of the separate effects. Third, accurate information on exposure and degree of avoidance of low {DO} were critical unknowns. Our interpretations should be viewed as suggestive rather than definitive. The patterns described were based on a collection of modeling results that were not designed to be compared to each other. A quick look at other models seems to confirm our patterns, or at minimum, does not contradict our patterns. Quantifying the effects of hypoxia on fish populations, whether large or small, is critical for effective management of coastal ecosystems and for cost-effective and efficient design of remediation actions. The potential for interaction and indirect effects complicates field study and management. Improving our predictions of the effects of hypoxia on fish populations and communities has moved from a computational issue to a biological issue. We seem to be making progress on monitoring and modeling movement behavior, but progress is slower in food web theory and empirical research and in quantifying interspecific interactions and habitat quality in terms of process rates that relate to population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Penaeid shrimp trawling effort in the Gulf of Mexico is not measured directly but is estimated from landings and interview data gathered by port agents of the National Marine Fisheries Service ({NMFS).} The total pounds landed from each trip are assigned to one or more of the 219 statistical area-depth zone cells for which a catch rate (pounds per nominal day fished or catch per unit effort ({CPUE))} is also obtained. Each month, the total landings in pounds for each cell are divided by the {CPUE} of the cell to determine effort or days fished. These values are summed across all cells and months to provide an estimate of total effort. The accuracy of total effort estimates is directly proportional to the accuracy of the landings allocations and estimated {CPUE} values. It has been assumed that allocation errors are random and that directional bias is negligible. In a previous paper, we described an electronic logbook ({ELB)} that enables accurate measurement of the spatial patterns of fishing effort. Herein, we provide comparisons of actual areas fished, pounds landed, and catch rates as measured with {ELBs} to the corresponding estimates made by {NMFS} port agents. The results show that directional bias occurs and that {CPUE} is often underestimated. Based on 135 trip comparisons, midshelf effort in 2000 was greatly overestimated, whereas nearshore and deepwater effort was substantially underestimated. If our effort results are representative, present estimates of the bycatch of midshelf species may therefore be greatly overestimated, whereas the converse may be true for nearshore and deepwater species. We suggest that a cooperative program involving both {NMFS} and industry should be implemented based on {ELB} technology and the port agent network to obtain more precise and accurate estimates of shrimp trawling effort with minimal impact on the fishers.},

	abstract = {Hypoxic conditions in the coastal waters off Texas ({USA)} were observed since the late 1970s, but little is known about the causes of stratification that contribute to hypoxia formation. Typically, this hypoxia is attributed to downcoast (southwestward) advection of waters from the {Mississippi–Atchafalaya} River system. Here, we present evidence for a hypoxic event on the inner shelf of Texas coincident with the presence of freshwater linked to high flow of the Brazos River in Texas. These conclusions are based on hydrographic observations and isotopic measurements of waters on the inner shelf near the Brazos River mouth. These data characterize the development, breakdown, and dispersal of a hypoxic event lasting from June through September 2007 off the Texas coast. Oxygen isotope compositions of shelf water indicate that (1) discharge from the Brazos River was the principal source of freshwater and water column stratification during the 2007 event, and (2) during low Brazos River discharge in 2008, freshwater on the Texas shelf was derived mainly from the {Mississippi–Atchafalaya} River System. Based on these findings, we conclude that the {Mississippi–Atchafalaya} River System is not the sole cause of hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico; however, more data are needed to determine the relative influence of the Texas versus Mississippi rivers during normal and low flow conditions of Texas rivers.},

	abstract = {Abstract The annual catch of brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus off Texas is forecasted by the National Marine Fisheries Service using a model that relates spring ({April–June)} juvenile abundance in Galveston Bay to subsequent offshore catch (July to the following June). The model is not well documented, nor has it been used rigorously to examine the success of management actions in enhancing the fishery. State and federal agencies use an areal closure of Gulf of Mexico waters deeper than 4 fathoms from late May to early July to increase shrimp abundance, catch, and value by delaying the harvest of emigrating juvenile shrimp. This study reports a preclosure (1960–1980) regression that explained over 70\% of the variation in offshore Texas catches as a function of the juvenile abundance index from Galveston Bay. Positive effects of the closure—in terms of increasing the catch for a given level of juvenile abundance in 1981–2007—were not found in this study. However, the utility of the relationship between the juvenile abundance index and catch as a forecasting tool continued through 2007, but with less precision than in the preclosure regression.},

	abstract = {The Mississippi River is one of the world's 10 largest rivers, with average freshwater discharge into the northern Gulf of Mexico ({GOM)} of 380 km3 year− 1. In the northern {GOM}, anthropogenic nitrogen is primarily derived from agricultural fertilizer and delivered via the Mississippi River. The general consensus is that hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico is caused primarily by algal production stimulated by excess nitrogen delivered from the {Mississippi–Atchafalaya} River Basin and seasonal vertical stratification of incoming stream flow and Gulf waters, which restricts replenishment of oxygen from the atmosphere. In this paper, we review the controversial aspects of the largely nutrient-centric view of the hypoxic region, and introduce the role of non-riverine organic matter inputs as other oxygen-consuming mechanisms. Similarly, we discuss non-nutrient physically-controlled impacts of freshwater stratification as an alternative mechanism for controlling in part, the seasonality of hypoxia. We then explore why hypoxia in this dynamic river-dominated margin ({RiOMar)} is not comparable to many of the other traditional estuarine systems (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Baltic Sea, and Long Island Sound). The presence of mobile muds and the proximity of the Mississippi Canyon are discussed as possible reasons for the amelioration of hypoxia (e.g., healthy fisheries) in this region. The most recent prediction of hypoxia area for 2009, using the current nutrient-centric models, failed due to the limited scope of these simple models and the complexity of this system. Predictive models should not be the main driver for management decisions. We postulate that a better management plan for this region can only be reached through a more comprehensive understanding of this {RiOMar} system—not just more information on river fluxes (e.g., nutrients) and coastal hypoxia monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {A new suite of multiple regression models was developed that describes relationships between the area of bottom water hypoxia along the northern Gulf of Mexico and {Mississippi–Atchafalaya} River nitrate concentration, total phosphorus ({TP)} concentration, and discharge. Model input variables were derived from two load estimation methods, the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation ({AMLE)} and the composite ({COMP)} method, developed by the {U.S.} Geological Survey. Variability in midsummer hypoxic area was described by models that incorporated May discharge, May nitrate, and February {TP} concentrations or their spring (discharge and nitrate) and winter ({TP)} averages. The regression models predicted the observed hypoxic area within ±30\%, yet model residuals showed an increasing trend with time. An additional model variable, Epoch, which allowed post-1993 observations to have a different intercept than earlier observations, suggested that hypoxic area has been 6450 km2 greater per unit discharge and nutrients since 1993. Model forecasts predicted that a dual 45\% reduction in nitrate and {TP} concentration would likely reduce hypoxic area to approximately 5000 km2, the coastal goal established by the Mississippi {River/Gulf} of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. However, the {COMP} load estimation method, which is more accurate than the {AMLE} method, resulted in a smaller predicted hypoxia response to any given nutrient reduction than models based on the {AMLE} method. Monte Carlo simulations predicted that five years after an instantaneous 50\% nitrate reduction or dual 45\% nitrate and {TP} reduction it would be possible to resolve a significant reduction in hypoxic area. However, if nutrient reduction targets were achieved gradually (e.g., over 10 years), much more than a decade would be required before a significant downward trend in both nutrient concentrations and hypoxic area could be resolved against the large background of interannual variability. The multiple regression models and statistical approaches applied provide improved capabilities for evaluating dual nutrient management strategies to address Gulf hypoxia and a clearer perspective on the strengths and limitations of approaching the problem using regression models.},

We conclude by proposing new areas of statistical and ecological research to further our understanding of how fish distribute and survive in space. This review serves a dual purpose by emphasizing the scientific importance of studying spatial interactions to better understand the temporal dynamics of fish abundance, and by promoting the development of new analytical and ecological approaches for the analysis of spatial data. Through our survey we cover different statistical techniques, marine ecosystems and life stages. This analytical, geographic and ontogenetic variety is also purposely selected to highlight the importance of comparative and multidisciplinary studies across diverging ecological disciplines, ecosystems and life stages. Besides having a general ecological relevance this review also bears a more applied significance, owing to the increasing need for protecting renewable marine resources along with their primary habitat.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia has become a world-wide phenomenon in the global coastal ocean and causes a deterioration of the structure and function of ecosystems. Based on the collective contributions of members of {SCOR} Working Group \#128, the present study provides an overview of the major aspects of coastal hypoxia in different biogeochemical provinces, including estuaries, coastal waters, upwelling areas, fjords and semi-enclosed basins, with various external forcings, ecosystem responses, feedbacks and potential impact on the sustainability of the fishery and economics. The obvious external forcings include freshwater runoff and other factors contributing to stratification, organic matter and nutrient loadings, as well as exchange between coastal and open ocean water masses. Their different interactions set up mechanisms that drive the system towards hypoxia. Coastal systems also vary in their relative susceptibility to hypoxia depending on their physical and geographic settings. It is understood that coastal hypoxia has a profound impact on the sustainability of ecosystems, which can be seen, for example, by the change in the food-web structure and system function; other influences include compression and loss of habitat, as well as changes in organism life cycles and reproduction. In most cases, the ecosystem responds to the low dissolved oxygen in non-linear ways with pronounced feedbacks to other compartments of the Earth System, including those that affect human society. Our knowledge and previous experiences illustrate that there is a need to develop new observational tools and models to support integrated research of biogeochemical dynamics and ecosystem behavior that will improve confidence in remediation management strategies for coastal hypoxia.},

Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the “laws” that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

	abstract = {In coastal marine ecosystems, hypoxia and anoxia are emerging as growing threats whose ecological impacts are difficult to ascertain because of the frequent lack of adequate references for comparison. We applied conventional and hierarchical ensemble analyses to evaluate the weight of evidence in support of hypoxia impacts on local densities of individual and groups of demersal fish and invertebrate species in Hood Canal, {WA}, which is subject to seasonal hypoxia in its southern reaches. Central to our approach was a sample design and analysis scheme that was designed specifically to consider multiple alternative hypotheses regarding factors that dictate local species’ densities. We anticipated persistent effects of hypoxia (felt even when seasonal hypoxia was absent) on species densities would be most pronounced for sessile species, but that immediate effects (felt only when seasonal hypoxia was present) would dominate for mobile species. Conventional analysis provided strong evidence that densities of sessile species were persistently reduced in the hypoxic-impacted site, but did not indicate widespread immediate density responses during hypoxic events among mobile species. The absence of strong weights of evidence for hypoxia effects was partly a consequence of alternative hypotheses that better explained spatial-temporal variation in species’ densities. The hierarchical ensemble analysis improved the precision of species-specific effect sizes, and also allowed us to make inferences about the response of aggregated groups of species. The estimated mean density reductions during hypoxic events (dissolved oxygen {\textasciitilde}2 mg/l) ranged from 73 to 98\% among mobile invertebrates, benthic, and benthopelagic fishes. The large reduction in benthic and benthopelagic species suggests substantial effects of hypoxia in Hood Canal even at oxygen levels that were marginally hypoxic. Understanding the full ecological consequence of hypoxia will require a greater knowledge on the spatial extent of distributional shifts and their effects on competitive and predator–prey interactions.},

This view, as reflected in {U.S.} and worldwide legislation and agreements, demonstrates the widely held belief that discarded portions of fishery catches (including economic resources, protected species, and unobserved mortalities of animals not caught) represent an unacceptable waste of natural resources. Bycatches in their various forms can have significant consequences for populations, food webs, and ecosystems. The economic effects of bycatches can influence not only the levels of yields to individual fisheries, but also may have major effects on allocations among competing fisheries. The lack of comprehensive monitoring programs in most areas to assess bycatches and integrate them into population and multispecies models seriously impedes a full understanding of bycatch consequences and the efficacy of measures for their amelioration. Nevertheless, where evidence for significant bycatches exists, a risk-averse and perhaps adaptive management philosophy is clearly warranted. Establishing the benefits and costs associated with bycatch management is a priority as managers attempt to define the practicality of bycatches approaching zero given the institutional, scientific, and industry resources necessary to accomplish the job.},

Here, we describe a simple and inexpensive electronic logbook ({ELB)} and algorithms tested to describe the temporal and spatial patterns of fishing effort, based on nothing more than the position of the vessel at 10-min intervals; these algorithms were tested with 788 tows (4,558 h of trawling). On average, the difference between {ELB} estimates and recorded levels of effort were less than 1\%; spatial agreement was also good. On a spatial basis, {ELB} estimates accounted for more than 84–97\% of the variance observed in recorded effort, depending on the grid size used in the analysis. Further, analysis of data from more than 18,000 tows yielded a strong within-trip relationship between catch and effort. This relationship enables accurate allocation of the total landings from a trip to the subareas fished, based on nothing more than trawling times within each subarea fished. Because National Marine Fisheries Service port agents already collect landings on a trip total basis, a large-scale installation of inexpensive ({\textless}{US\$500)} {ELB} units should be able to measure shrimp fishing effort accurately.},

It also offers suggestions for future efforts related to simulating and forecasting Gulf hypoxia. The existing hypoxia models for the northern Gulf of Mexico range from simple regression models to complex three-dimensional simulation models, and they capture very different aspects of the physics, chemistry, and biology of this region. Several of these models were successfully calibrated to observations relevant for their process formulations and spatial-temporal scales. Available model results are compared to reach the consensus that large-scale hypoxia probably did not begin in the Gulf of Mexico until the mid 1970s, and that the 30\% nitrogen load reduction that is called for by the Action Plan may not be sufficient to achieve its goal. The present models results suggest that a 40—45\% reduction in riverine nitrogen load may be necessary to achieve the desired reduction in the areal extent of hypoxia. These model results underscore the importance of setting this goal as a running average because of significant interannual variability. Caution is raised for setting resource management goals without considering the long-term consequences of climate variability and change.},

	abstract = {Since systematic measurements of Louisiana continental-shelf waters were initiated in 1985, hypoxia (oxygen content {\textless}2 mg L−1) has increased considerably in an area termed the dead zone. Monitoring and modeling studies have concluded that the expansion of the Louisiana shelf dead zone is related to increased anthropogenically derived nutrient delivery from the Mississippi River drainage basin, physical and hydrographical changes of the Louisiana Shelf, and possibly coastal erosion of wetlands in southern Louisiana. In order to track the development and expansion of seasonal low-oxygen conditions on the Louisiana shelf prior to 1985, we used a specific low-oxygen foraminiferal faunal proxy, the {PEB} index, which has been shown statistically to represent the modern Louisiana hypoxia zone. We constructed a network of 13 {PEB} records with excess {210Pb-derived} chronologies to establish the development of low-oxygen and hypoxic conditions over a large portion of the modern dead zone for the last 100 years. The {PEB} index record indicates that areas of low-oxygen bottom water began to appear in the early 1910s in isolated hotspots near the Mississippi Delta and rapidly expanded across the entire Louisiana shelf beginning in the 1950s. Since {\textasciitilde}1950, the percentage of {PEB} species has steadily increased over a large portion of the modern dead zone. By 1960, subsurface low-oxygen conditions were occurring seasonally over a large part of the geographic area now known as the dead zone. The long-term trends in the {PEB} index are consistent with the 20th-century observational and proxy data for low oxygen and hypoxia.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT:} Certain ecological processes dominate others at particular scales, and the response of populations to exogenous and endogenous forces are typically scale dependent. In spite of this central role played by scale, the temporal and spatial scales of human impacts on ecosystems and populations remain almost unknown. We applied a multiscale regression analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal scales which characterize the fisheries exploitation of yellowfin sole Limanda aspera in the Bering Sea. We found that harvesting affects the abundance of this species simultaneously at local and regional scales. At the local scale harvesting produced a negative effect on local fish densities, particularly in those areas and seasons of high fish aggregation, when both the vulnerability of the fish and the fishing effort increase. At the regional scale harvesting was characterized by a widespread negative effect on the whole fish population. Our findings demonstrate that (1) detection of the fisheries exploitation effects on natural populations is sensitive to the scale of investigation, (2) fisheries harvesting can simultaneously affect multiple ecological scales which are not linearly correlated with each other. We developed analytical techniques for the detection of scale-dependent processes, which can be readily applied to other systems. Our results provide insights on the risks of extrapolating the effects of harvesting on natural populations across scales, making the issues of scale and space central to the management and conservation of natural populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Fisheries of enclosed and semi‐enclosed seas provide the first basis for evaluating human impacts on marine ecosystems. These have become of serious concern before similar changes are detectable in oceanic systems, thus emphasizing their value as laboratories for comparative study of man‐induced changes. The paper discusses the relevance of the cline, oligo‐meso‐eu‐dys‐trophic to stressed marine systems, and focuses on impacts on fisheries of enhanced nutrient runoff, noting common features with marine systems subject to natural enrichment, but also with well‐studied freshwater systems. It is suggested that under nutrient enrichment and heavy fishing, both “top down”; and “bottom up”; trophic mechanisms act in synchrony to change the trophic chain, leading initially to increased fishery productivity of formerly oligotrophic systems, followed by more drastic and negative changes as nutrient input passes beyond a state that may be called mesotrophic. Nutrient enrichment and overfishing have similar and synergistic effects: a decline in diversity, an initial increase in productivity of benthic/demersal and pelagic food webs, then the progressive dominance of the production system by short‐lived, especially pelagic, species. The separation of these two anthropogenic effects on semi‐enclosed seas is difficult and has been confounded by the synchronous growth of industrial fishing, and of downstream impacts of growing populations, industrialization and agro‐industry, and growing water usage, especially since World War {II.} A description of human impacts on several semi‐enclosed seas emphasizes the Marine Catchment Basin ({MCB)} concept, noting that ranking by the relative extents of catchment area and marine basin explains much of the observed impact. A systems approach to management of inland and coastal seas is suggested, with priority on the control of nutrient flows between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and the establishment of accurate statistical systems integrating fisheries and environmental data over whole basins and coastal seas.},

	abstract = {We used fishery-independent hydrographic and bottom trawl surveys on the northwestern Gulf of Mexico shelf from 1983–2000 to test for density dependence and effects of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen 2.0 {mg·L–1)} on the spatial distribution of brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus). Spatial distribution of shrimp was positively related to abundance on the Texas shelf but negatively related to abundance on the Louisiana shelf. Density dependence was weak, however, and may have been due to factors other than density-dependent habitat selection. Males were distributed over a broader area and further offshore than were females, though differences in spatial distribution between sexes were not large ({\textasciitilde}10\%–15\%). Large-scale hypoxia (up to {\textasciitilde}20 000 km2) on the Louisiana shelf occurs in regions of typically high shrimp density and results in substantial habitat loss (up to {\textasciitilde}25\% of the Louisiana shelf), with shifts in distribution and associated high densities both inshore and offshore of the hypoxic region. We discuss these results in terms of the generality of density-dependent spatial distributions in marine populations and potential consequences of habitat loss and associated shifts in distribution due to low dissolved {oxygen.Des} inventaires hydrographiques et des inventaires au chalut indépendants de la pêche commerciale faits dans le nord-ouest du golfe du Mexique de 1983 à 2000 nous ont servi à évaluer la dépendance de la densité, ainsi que les effets de l'hypoxie (oxygène dissous 2,0 {mg·L–1)} sur la répartition spatiale de la crevette brune (Farfantepenaeus aztecus). Il existe une relation positive entre la répartition spatiale de la crevette et son abondance sur la plate-forme continentale du Texas et une relation négative avec son abondance sur la plate-forme continentale de la Louisiane. Cependant, la dépendance de la densité est faible et peut être due à des facteurs non reliés à un choix d'habitat dépendant de la densité. Les mâles sont répartis sur une plus grande surface et plus au large que les femelles, bien que les différences de répartition spatiale entre les sexes ne soit pas importante ({\textasciitilde}10–15 \%). L'hypoxie à grande échelle (jusqu'à {\textasciitilde}20 000 km2) sur la plate-forme de la Louisiane se produit typiquement dans les zones de forte densité de crevettes et entraîne une perte considérable d'habitat (jusqu'à {\textasciitilde}25 \% de la plate-forme de la Louisiane); il s'ensuit des modifications de la répartition et des fortes densités qui lui sont associées, tant au large de la région hypoxique que vers la côte. La discussion de ces résultats se fait dans le contexte général des répartitions spatiales dépendantes de la densité chez les populations marines et en rapport avec les conséquences potentielles de la perte d'habitat et des modifications des aires de répartition qui en résultent à cause des faibles teneurs d'oxygène dissous.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

The {VGLM/VGAM} framework is very general and is shown to include many popular fisheries regression models such as {GLMs} and {GAMs}, the negative binomial ({NB)}, the zero-inflated Poisson ({ZIP)} and {ZINB}, the zero-altered Poisson ({ZAP)} and {ZANB} as special cases. The primary purpose of this article is to introduce the {VGLM/VGAM} methodology into fisheries science. To this end, data from the 2008 {FIPS-MOUCHE} World Fly Fishing Championships is used to illustrate the chief advantages of the framework, viz. its large size and its ability to fit each model in a very flexible manner. Having a large framework leads to greater efficiencies in the practical modelling of data. The specific questions examined fall under two categories: (i) what distribution do the fish lengths have in each of the sectors? (ii) can fish catch reduction be detected and if so, how can the effects be ameliorated? As well as the above models, the utility of several other seemingly disparate regression models to fisheries research are presented, such as the bivariate odds-ratio model, the generalized extreme value distribution, and several quantile regression techniques.},

	abstract = {Bycatch of unwanted, prohibited, or protected species is a problem in most commercial fisheries. Trawl fisheries are particularly prone to bycatch problems because trawls are not species-selective. In this paper, I review the history of finfish bycatch research in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery and explore the use of quotas to reduce finfish bycatch by examining four fisheries that currently use bycatch quotas: (1) the arrow squid trawl fishery of New Zealand, which uses fleet bycatch quotas for sea lion bycatch, (2) the Alaskan groundfish trawl fisheries, which use fleet quotas under a “vessel incentive program” for prohibited species, (3) the groundfish trawl fishery of British Columbia, Canada which uses individual vessel bycatch quotas for prohibited species, and (4) the multi-species trawl fisheries of New Zealand, which use catch balancing, or individual transferable quotas, for most commercially landed species. Based on the bycatch quota experiences in these fisheries, elements of successful bycatch quota programs include: (1) individual accountability, in the form of individual or cooperative bycatch quotas, rather than fleet quotas, (2) 100\% observer coverage, (3) relatively small, manageable fleets, (4) limited landing ports that can be easily monitored, particularly if observer coverage is incomplete, (5) reliable enforcement, (6) penalties that are true disincentives, and (7) some flexibility in the system for fishermen to have alternatives to manage their bycatch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery, with an estimated 20,000 licensed boats, is currently too large for individual bycatch quotas to be practical, although individual or cooperative bycatch quotas would be excellent strategies for reducing the bycatch of a smaller fleet. Mobile closed areas might be beneficial for reducing the bycatch of particular species, but these short-term closures would require real-time monitoring of bycatch rates and vessel monitoring systems on all vessels. However, under any management regime, incentives and/or rigorously enforced disincentives are the key to successful bycatch reduction.},

As a result, the symptoms of eutrophication, such as noxious and harmful algal blooms, reduced water quality, loss of habitat and natural resources, and severity of hypoxia (oxygen depletion) and its extent in estuaries and coastal waters will increase. Global climate changes will likely result in higher water temperatures, stronger stratification, and increased inflows of freshwater and nutrients to coastal waters in many areas of the globe. Both past experience and model forecasts suggest that these changes will result in enhanced primary production, higher phytoplankton and macroalgal standing stocks, and more frequent or severe hypoxia. The negative consequences of increased nutrient loading and stratification may be partly, but only temporarily, compensated by stronger or more frequent tropical storm activity in low and mid-latitudes. In anticipation of the negative effects of global change, nutrient loadings to coastal waters need to be reduced now, so that further water quality degradation is prevented.},

We apply a spatially explicit regression framework that incorporates localized, interactive and threshold effects of both density-independent (water temperature) and density-dependent (population abundance) variables, to study the spatial distribution of a well-monitored flatfish population in the eastern Bering Sea. Results indicate that when population biomass was beyond a threshold a further increase in biomass-promoted habitat expansion in a non-additive fashion with water temperature. In contrast, during years of low population size, habitat occupancy was affected positively only by water temperature. These results reveal the spatial signature of intraspecific abundance distribution relationships as well as the non-additive and non-stationary responses of species spatial dynamics.

We characterized the community structure of mobile fishes and invertebrates (i.e., nekton) in and around the hypoxic zone using 3 years of bottom trawl and hydrographic data. Species richness and total abundance were lowest in anoxic waters ({DO} ≤ 1 mg l−1) and increased at intermediate {DO} levels (2–4 mg l−1). Species were primarily structured as a benthic assemblage dominated by Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) and sand and silver seatrout (Cynoscion spp.), and a pelagic assemblage dominated by Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus). Of the environmental variables examined, bottom {DO} and distance to the edge of the hypoxic zone were most strongly correlated with assemblage structure, while temperature and depth were important in some years. Hypoxia altered the spatial distribution of both assemblages, but these effects were more severe for the benthic assemblage than for the pelagic assemblage. Brown shrimp, the primary target of the commercial shrimp trawl fishery during the summer, occurred in both assemblages, but was more abundant within the benthic assemblage. Given the similarity of the demersal nekton community described here to that taken as bycatch in the shrimp fishery, our results suggest that hypoxia-induced changes in spatial dynamics have the potential to influence harvest and bycatch interactions in and around the Gulf hypoxic zone.},

	abstract = {Seasonally severe hypoxia (≤2 mg O2 l−1) occurs in waters below the pycnocline on the northern Gulf of Mexico inner continental shelf in May through September over extensive areas (up to 18 000 km2). Spatial and temporal variability in the distribution of hypoxic water masses is related, in part, to the amplitude and phasing of freshwater discharge from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers, circulation patterns, nutrient flux and a close coupling with net productivity. The Mississippi River flood in 1993 and sustained freshwater inputs to the Gulf of Mexico occurred during mid-summer through early autumn when long-term mean flows (1930–1995) are normally lowest. Long-term studies of the Louisiana shelf hypoxic zone provided a natural experiment to examine the effects of extreme high river flow on the adjacent continental shelf. Oxygen levels in bottom waters were severely reduced in July, August and September compared to long-term averages (1985–1992). Also, the areal extent of the bottom-water hypoxia in mid-summer 1993 was approximately twice as large as the average area mapped in the previous 8 years during mid-summer shelfwide surveys. Contributing to increased severity and areal extent of hypoxia in 1993 were reduced surface water salinities, increased strength of the pycnocline, five to ten times higher nutrient concentrations, greater phytoplankton biomass, an order of magnitude greater abundance of phytoplankton, mostly small, coccoid cyanobacteria, and a shift in diatom community dynamics. An equally extensive hypoxic zone in mid-summer of 1994, when riverine fluxes of freshwater and nutrients were ‘normal’, suggests some residual effects of the 1993 summer flooding. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The assumption that hypoxia is a natural feature of the coastal ecosystem in the northern Gulf of Mexico influenced by the discharge of the Mississippi River system is not supported by paleoindicators in accumulated sediments. There is a propensity for the ecosystem to develop hypoxia because of the high discharge of the Mississippi River and physical dynamics on the continental shelf that support stratification. However, paleoindicators of eutrophication and oxygen conditions record recent anthropogenic influences. The evidence for increased carbon production and accumulation comes from diatoms and their remnants, marine-origin carbon in the sediments, and phytoplankton pigments. Surrogates for oxygen condition, including mineral, isotopic, microfossil, and phytoplankton pigment indicators, indicate worsening oxygen stress. The changes are more apparent in areas of present chronic hypoxia and are coincident with the increasing nitrogen loads from the Mississippi River system beginning in the 1950s. Longer-term shifts in offshore ecology parallel landscape changes within the watershed in the last two centuries. The temporal shifts in this coastal ecosystem parallel the time sequence of similarly eutrophied coastal waters globally and coincide nicely with sediment analyses from other locations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Unraveling the diverse forces controlling the abundance and distribution of fish across a landscape has been challenging, in part because few techniques exist to address multiple factors simultaneously in a single analysis. We used spatially explicit, varying-coefficient generalized additive models to relate the summertime abundance and distribution of yellow perch Perca flavescens to a variety of predatory, water quality, landscape, and density-dependent factors. The model used 25 years of fishery-independent trawling data from southern Green Bay, Lake Michigan, an area that supported major fisheries for yellow perch until their decline in the 1990s. Local catch per unit effort ({CPUE)} of both age-0 and age-1 and older yellow perch was affected by the abundance of double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus, dissolved oxygen, water clarity, and bottom depth, but not water temperature. In addition, the local response of age-0 yellow perch {CPUE} to most predictor variables, including their own global density, had a unique spatial structure. For instance, increased cormorant abundance was related to declines in local yellow perch {CPUE}, especially near cormorant nesting islands, while increased dissolved oxygen levels were correlated with increased local yellow perch {CPUE} in shallow nearshore areas of southern Green Bay. In addition, local yellow perch {CPUE} increased near the mouth of the Fox River during years with higher water clarity, suggesting that water quality may be limiting to yellow perch in this region. Our results suggest that it is important to explicitly account for the different ways in which predictor variables influence fish abundance across the aquatic landscape.

	abstract = {We review the general theory regarding habitat selection in fishes and integrate this theory with recent data to evaluate habitat selection by marsh fishes. Models of habitat selection in fishes have evolved rapidly. The earliest models predicted habitat selection based on simple variables like temperature or salinity. Optimal foraging models project habitat selection of individuals based on food availability. Environmental factors and food can be integrated using bioenergetic models to predict the distribution of individuals based on bioenergetic optimization. Habitat selection can be modified by the presence of other individuals including competitors (theory based on ideal free distributions) and predators (theory based on trade-offs of growth vs. predation risk). The most current models use game theory to project the dynamics of habitat selection for both prey species and their mobile predators. In a review of marsh ecosystems, we found that little information is currently available with which to evaluate potential mechanisms underlying patterns of habitat use in these systems. Though marshes are widely considered important for foraging and predator refuge, this function has rarely been measured or critically evaluated. In contrast, measurement has focused on abiotic factors, resulting in a mismatch between factors cited as important and those actually measured. Existing theory on habitat selection in fishes combined with the strong empirical base that has been developed on patterns of habitat use in marsh fishes provides a unique opportunity to begin testing relevant mechanisms underlying distributional patterns. A mechanistic approach is necessary to understand the functional value of habitat to organisms as well as provide a basis for the implementation and evaluation of habitat restoration and management initiatives.},

	abstract = {Walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma (pollock hereafter) is a key ecological and economic species in the eastern Bering Sea, yet detailed synthesis of the spatial and temporal patterns of pollock ichthyoplankton in this important region is lacking. This knowledge gap is particularly severe considering that egg and larval distribution are essential to reconstructing spawning locations and early life stages drift pathways. We used 19 yr of ichthyoplankton collections to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of egg and larval distribution. Generalized additive models ({GAMs)} identified two primary temporal pulses of pollock eggs, the first occurring from 20 February to 31 March and the second from 20 April to 20 May; larvae showed similar, but slightly lagged, pulses. Based on generalized cross-validation and information theory, a {GAM} model that allowed for different seasonal patterns in egg density within three unique areas outperformed a {GAM} that assumed a single fixed seasonal pattern across the entire eastern Bering Sea. This ‘area-dependent’ {GAM} predicted the highest densities of eggs (i.e., potential spawning locations) in three major areas of the eastern Bering Sea: near Bogoslof Island ({February–April)}, north of Unimak Island and the Alaska Peninsula ({March–April)}, and around the Pribilof Islands ({April–August).} Unique temporal patterns of egg density were observed for each area, suggesting that pollock spawning may be more spatially and temporally complex than previously assumed. Moreover, this work provides a valuable baseline of pollock spawning to which future changes, such as those resulting from climate variability, may be compared.},

	abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory1. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods2, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a ‘synthetic likelihood’ that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson’s classic blowfly experiments3, 4, 5.},

	abstract = {Over 20 years of egg sampling data were used to reconstruct the geographical and phenological patterns of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) spawning aggregations in the Gulf of Alaska ({GOA).} The analyzed time series (1972, 1978-1979, 1981-2000) included a documented event of climate change (i.e., 1988-1989) and the rise and fall of the {GOA} pollock population abundance and harvests. We compared results from two generalized additive model ({GAM)} formulations: one assuming no change of egg distribution and phenology over the examined time series (stationary) and the other admitting such changes (nonstationary) across an epoch determined from the data. Results from both model formulations corroborate the existence of a high egg concentration in Shelikof Strait, historically the primary spawning area of pollock in the {GOA.} However, model results also highlight the presence of other secondary, and possibly transitory, centers of egg distribution at various locations along the shelf and slope regions of the {GOA.} In addition, results from the nonstationary (and statistically superior) formulation indicate that the abundance of the non-Shelikof aggregations has increased over time, along with a tendency for earlier occurrence and displacement toward shallower areas of the high egg density {regions.Nous} avons utilisé des données d'échantillonnage des oeufs sur plus de 20 ans pour reconstituer les patrons géographiques et phénologiques des rassemblements de fraye de la goberge de {l'Alaska} (Theragra chalcogramma) dans le golfe de {l'Alaska} (« {GOA} »). Les séries chronologiques analysées (1972, 1978-1979, 1981-2000) incluent un épisode bien documenté de changement climatique (soit en 1988-1989), ainsi que la croissance et le déclin de l'abondance et des récoltes de goberges dans le {GOA.} Nous comparons les résultats provenant de deux formulations du modèle additif généralisé (« {GAM} »), l'une (stationnaire) qui ne présuppose aucun changement dans la répartition et la phénologie des oeufs dans la série chronologique examinée, alors que l'autre (non stationnaire) permet de tels changements sur une période déterminé à partir des données. Les résultats des deux formulations du modèle corroborent l'existence d'une forte concentration d'oeufs dans le détroit de Shelikof, qui est historiquement le principal site de fraye de la goberge dans le {GOA.} Cependant, les résultats du modèle soulignent aussi la présence d'autres centres secondaires, et peut-être transitoires, de répartition des oeufs à différents points dans les régions du plateau et du talus continentaux du {GOA.} De plus, les résultats de la formulation non stationnaire (plus robuste statistiquement) indique que l'abondance des rassemblements autres que celui de Shelikof a augmenté au cours des années, qu'il y a une tendance pour que ces rassemblements aient lieu plus tôt et qu'il y a un déplacement des régions de forte densité des oeufs vers des sites moins profonds.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	abstract = {The second largest zone of coastal hypoxia (oxygen-depleted waters) in the world is found on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf adjacent to the outflows of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The combination of high freshwater discharge, wind mixing, regional circulation, and summer warming controls the strength of stratification that goes through a well-defined seasonal cycle. The physical structure of the water column and high nutrient loads that enhance primary production lead to an annual formation of the hypoxic water mass that is dominant from spring through late summer. Paleoindicators in dated sediment cores indicate that hypoxic conditions likely began to appear around the turn of the last century and became more severe since the 1950s as the nitrate flux from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico tripled. Whereas increased nutrients enhance the production of some organisms, others are eliminated from water masses (they either emigrate from the area or die) where the oxygen level falls below 2 mg 1-1 or lower for a prolonged period. A hypoxia-stressed benthos is typified by short-lived, smaller surface deposit-feeding polychaetes and the absence of marine invertebrates such as pericaridean crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, and ophiuroids. The changes in benthic communities, along with the low dissolved oxygen, result in altered sediment structure and sediment biogeochemical cycles. Important fisheries are variably affected by increased or decreased food supplies, mortality, forced migration, reduction in suitable habitat, increased susceptibility to predation, and disruption of life cycles.},

	abstract = {Unselective fishing catches non-target organisms as ‘bycatch’—an issue of critical ocean conservation and resource management concern. However, the situation is confused because perceptions of target and non-target catch vary widely, impeding efforts to estimate bycatch globally. To remedy this, the term needs to be redefined as a consistent definition that establishes what should be considered bycatch. A new definition is put forward as: ‘bycatch is catch that is either unused or unmanaged’. Applying this definition to global marine fisheries data conservatively indicates that bycatch represents 40.4 percent of global marine catches, exposing systemic gaps in fisheries policy and management.},

	abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and social–psychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},
